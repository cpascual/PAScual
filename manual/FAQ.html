<h2 id="toc1">General</h2>

<ol>
    <li><h3 id="toc2">What is PAScual?</h3>
 PAScual is a program (or more precisely, a suite of programs) for analysing Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) spectra.<a name="faqn2"></a></li>
    <li><h3 id="toc3">How much does PAScual cost?</h3>
 Nothing. It is free. Furthermore, it is <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" rel="nofollow">free as in 'freedom'</a>. Its source code is available under the <a class="wiki_link" href="License.html">General Public License</a> for everybody to study it, modify it, etc.<a name="faqn3"></a></li>
    <li><h3 id="toc4">If everybody can see the code, What prevents competing programs to steal the ideas in PAScual?</h3>
 The answer is that I don't see other programs as &quot;competitors&quot;. I hope that PAScual is useful for everybody. I also expect that if someone finds PAScual useful, will acknowledge it by, e.g., citing. If other programs want to use some idea in my code, they are welcome (although if they use the code directly, they should respect the ters of the <a class="wiki_link" href="license.html">license</a>. Anyway, I used other people's ideas (written in articles) when implementing PAScual.</li>
    <li><h3 id="toc5">What does the name 'PAScual' stand for?</h3>
 One could pretend that 'PAScual' stands for something like 'Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy controlled universal analysis layer', but the fact is that it is just a pretentious way of playing with the author's family name.</li>
</ol>

<br />
<h2 id="toc6">Installation and use</h2>

<ol>
    <li><h3 id="toc7">What do I need to use PAScual?</h3>
 PAScual is written in Python. This means that you need to install a Python interpreter. PAScual also makes use of Scipy so you need to have that installed as well. Finally, You will need the Qt libraries and PyQt if you want to use the graphical user interface. Matplotlib is needed only if you want to generate graphics from the command line interface. Make sure you read the <a class="wiki_link" href="User%20Manual.html#installation">Installation section</a> of the <a class="wiki_link" href="User%20Manual.html">User Manual</a> to get the most comprehensive information regarding to the required packages.<a name="faqn4"></a></li>
    <li><h3 id="toc8">Where can I download PAScual?</h3>
 Surprisingly, this can be done by following the link called <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=217818" rel="nofollow">Download</a>. In general, you should download and install the latest available version.<a name="faqn5"></a></li>
    <li><h3 id="toc9">Where can I get some information about installing/using PAScual?</h3>
 The main source of information is the <a class="wiki_link" href="User%20Manual.html">User Manual</a>.You may also want to have a look at the <a class="wiki_link_new" href="documentation.html">documentation</a> section. Finally, don't forget that PAScual is Free (as in freedom), so you can read its source code if you <strong>really</strong> want to know what's going on. Of course, you can also <a class="wiki_link" href="contact.html">ask the author</a> for help.<a name="faqn6"></a></li>

<h2 id="toc10">Bugs/errors</h2>

<ol>
    <li><h3 id="toc11">PAScual crashes/does not work... what should I do?</h3>
 First, make sure you have all the <a class="wiki_link" href="User%20Manual.html#required">required</a> packages installed. Also make sure you download <a class="wiki_link_new" href="the%20latest%20stable%20version.html">the latest stable version</a>. Then try to reproduce the examples in the <a class="wiki_link" href="User%20Manual.html">User Manual</a>. If these fail, <a class="wiki_link" href="contact.html">contact</a> the author. If the problem is with your own data, please contact the author sending:<ul>
        <li>a detailed description of the problem</li>
        <li>the details of your installation (operative system), version of PAScual and of the required packages</li>
        <li>A list of the steps needed to reproduce the error</li>
        <li>the data that causes the trouble</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><h3 id="toc12">I found a problem/bug in PAScual. How do I report it?</h3>
 At this moment no formal bug reporting procedure is stablished. Just <a class="wiki_link" href="contact.html">contact</a> the author.</li>
    <li><h3 id="toc13">I solved a bug (or added a feature) in PAScual. Are you interested in my solution?</h3>
 Deffinitely!. Please send the code or the patch to the author. Of course, credits will be given. Also, if you are capable of programming and want to get involved in developing PAScual, you are more than welcome to do it. Just <a class="wiki_link" href="contact.html">contact</a> the author.</li>
