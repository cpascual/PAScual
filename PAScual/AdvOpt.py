#### IMPORTANT:
#### The following parameters are not supposed to be changed by regular users. They deal with internal algorithmical choices.
#### The default values are generally correct. Don't mess with them if you don't know exactly what you are doing

SA_tol = 1e-5  # (*3)Tolerance for stopping the SA
SA_stopT = .1  # (*3)Stop temperature for SA (put to 0 to disable). (SA_stopT>1 is not recommended)
SA_maxiter = inf  # (*3)Max number of iterations in the SimAnn fit
SA_direct = True  # (*3)Whether to use the direct mode in NNRLA for SA. Note: If SA_NNRLA=False (or <=0), SA_direct is ignored.
SA_meltratio = 0.97  # (*3)The "melting" phase of the SA will stop when this acceptance ratio is reached

LOCAL_tol = 0  # (NOT USED) (*3)Local search tolerance (the lower, the more time it will take). Put this to 0 to skip Local search and ~1e-5 for calculating
LOCAL_maxiter = 1e5  # (NOT USED) (*3)Max number of iterations in the LOCAL fit.
LOCAL_maxunbound = 10  # Max number of unbound LMA runs between L-BFGS-B optimisations (this only takes place if first LMA is outside bounds)

BI_stab = 5000  # (*3)This much steps (multiplied by the order of the searching space!) of BI will be done and not considered for statistical purposes. Put this to 0 to skip stabilisation.
BI_length = 50000  # (*3)This much steps (multiplied by the order of the searching space) will be calculated by BI.
BI_savehist = False  # This controls wheter the fitpar history should be saved (=FileName) or not (=False).
# Caution!: this will increase the RAM requeriments. Approximately by 11Bytes*BI_length*(3+2*NC)^2 , where NC is the number of components!
# BI_savehist='PAShist.txt'


seed = 1345  # Seed for pseudorandom generator

##
BI_report = 500  # A report will be shown every this steps during BI (put to -1 for no reports). Be Careful: too much reports may slow down the calc.
